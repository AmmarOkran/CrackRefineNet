# CrackRefineNet
### A Context- and Refinement-Driven Architecture for Robust Crack Segmentation under Real-World and Zero-Shot Conditions
This repository provides the official implementation of **CrackRefineNet**, a context- and refinement-driven convolutional architecture for **robust crack segmentation** under various conditions.  
CrackRefineNet is implemented using **[MMSegmentation v1.1.1](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/tree/v1.1.1)** as the core framework.
